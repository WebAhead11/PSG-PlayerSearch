          P A R I S. Five letters that mean so much around the world.
          Historically a world apart, culturally unique, the City of Light
          shines just as brightly on the sporting stage, with a clear leading
          light of Rouge et Bleu.

              Since 1970, the club has been working its magic in the west of the
              capital, at the Parc des Princes. In just a few years, Paris
              Saint-Germain emerged as the reference point of the French
              sporting landscape. In its first 41 years of existence, the club
              'Made in Paris' won no less than 18 trophies, including the 1996
              UEFA Cup Winners Cup. Already a benchmark, the club took another
              steep upward curve in 2011 under the direction of Qatar Sports
              Investments. It was the start of a new era, the most successful in
              the history of the French game.

          <div class="p1">
            The facts are established: since, Paris has since built its status
            as a global city in all fields. And if elegance and respect are
            engraved in the DNA of the city, these attributes now shine through
            in its ambassadors, dressed in red and blue. A particularity that
            now applies in plural in a triptych. Men's football, women's
            football, handball and judo: the badge now wants to federate and be
            the motor of a project size XXL.

            GLOBAL BRAND
            <div class="p2">
              In a time of globalisation, Paris Saint-Germain 2.0 wants to cover
              many disciplines and be transversal too, in order to shine even
              brighter. It's unique in France: the badge has become a global
              brand, worn by VIP (Very Important Parisians) such as Beckham,
              Neymar Jr, Kylian Mbapp√©, Nadia Nadim and Karabatic. The never
              before attempted gamble has proved successful. A vector of
              communication and open by its nature to the international scene,
              the capital club surfed on the wave in order to capitalise in
              terms of success. The target was set - win - and the trophy room
              filled up. In only 9 years, the men's team reached 25 trophies by
              August 2020 placing it in "pole position" when it comes to the
              most domestic trophies won by a French club.
